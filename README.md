# GeoSkylines
Cities: Skylines game mod for import/export of geodata. 
The development of GeoSkylines was focused on providing following features: 
•	Additional import/export of buildings and zones
•	Game roads are named according to the source road data
•	Minimalistic design of the mod so it is less prone to break after frequent game updates
•	Not tied directly to OSM, other datasets can be used
•	More freedom in formatting the source geodata before importing them into the game
•	Standard coordinate conversion methods
